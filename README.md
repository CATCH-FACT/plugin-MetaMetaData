The MetaMetaData plugin adds the functionality to set the status of a metadata field.
If a user or an annotator isn't sure about a value, the metadata field status can be set to disputed or erroneous.

A hidden functionality is the possibility to specify if a value is computer generated. If this value is set, it can be proofread and approved. This functionality will be used in the future by a plugin for automatic metadata generation.

Future functionalities:

- An option for the individual fields to be published on the public site.
- extreme content
- copyrighted content

- define own metametadata types in stead of predetermined (disputed, erroneous, generated, generated_score, proofread)
